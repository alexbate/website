<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
In this paper, we present a combinatorial problem based on the strengths of cards in a
card game and show how an efficient algorithm can be conceived through a series of logical
steps. In the process, we will see how various properties of sets can be exploited to our
advantage. Finally, we include a simple and elegant implementation of the algorithm in
Haskell.
