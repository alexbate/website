<h3>LaTeX Templates</h3>

<p>
    I have a collection of LaTeX templates for students (and staff) at the University of Nottingham for the following purposes:
</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Group and individual reports for G52GRP</li>
    <li>Dissertation template for G53IDS and related modules</li>
    <li>General purpose coursework reports</li>
    <li>Exam papers</li>
</ul>
    
<p>
    You can <a href="http://www.michael-gale.co.uk/web/templates.zip">download</a> all templates in one zip-compressed archive. Note that I have updated them as of April 2012.
</p>
    
<p>
    These templates have been used extensively in practise by myself and others so that they should provide you with good starting points for your own works.
    If you have any suggestions or questions, do not hesitate to contact me. I am also happy to provide the LaTeX sources for my publications which are not based on 
    these templates upon request.
