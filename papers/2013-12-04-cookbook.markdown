<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) has been described in a number of different ways, sometimes resulting in incorrect implementations. We believe that this was caused by previous, imprecise attempts to describe the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to remove this imprecision through a new approach inspired by purely functional programming. We have used the new specification to implement the deterministic DCA in Haskell and conducted a sensitivity analyses on it, which demonstrates the two key parameters of the algorithm and provides an example as to how the algorithm can be applied to event correlation problems in cyber security. We hope that our description will help improve the quality of future DCA related research and to help others understand which problems are most suited for use with this algorithm.
